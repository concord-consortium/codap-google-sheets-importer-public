# CODAP Google Sheets Importer

A CODAP plugin that imports data from google sheets.

## Permissions

Unlike https://github.com/stardust66/codap-google-sheets-importer, this plugin
does not require user login, or permission to view all of the user's
spreadsheets. This avoids needing to have the application verified by Google.
Consequently, the plugin can only import from public sheets.
